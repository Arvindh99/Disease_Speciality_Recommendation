# Predicting Disease based on the Symptoms and identifying specialist based on predicted disease

### Dataset and Model

The dataset contains information about symptoms, diseases, recommended doctors for each disease, and descriptions of the diseases. Using a classification model, diseases have been predicted based on the given symptoms. The predictions provide insights into the predicted disease, the likelihood or chance of that disease based on the classification model, the recommended doctor to visit for that disease, and a description of the predicted disease.

### Output Summary

    1. Predicted Disease: -The disease that has been predicted based on the symptoms provided.-
    2. Chance of the Disease: -The likelihood or probability of having that disease, as determined by the classification model.-
    3. Recommended Doctor: -The doctor or specialist recommended to visit for further evaluation or treatment of the predicted disease.-
    4. Description of the Disease: -A brief overview or description of the predicted disease, providing additional information about its symptoms, causes, and potential treatments.

This summary aims to provide a concise and informative overview of the predicted disease, its associated likelihood, the recommended doctor, and a brief description to aid in understanding and decision-making regarding the predicted disease.
